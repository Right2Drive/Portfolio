# Web Portfolio
---

## Purpose

One of my first projects in Javascript, this was my initial attempt to build a web portfolio, as well as explore the usage of the module pattern. I took an object oriented approach, doing my best to avoid code duplication, which resulted in most of the website being rendered in javascript. 

Unfortunately, I underestimated the scope of what I set out to achieve, and the project has since been abandoned. I do intend to start another portfolio now that I have more experience with web development, although such a project has not yet been initiated. Feel free to browse the source, but I'm sure it is riddled with bad practices and poor design choices. You've been warned :octocat:
